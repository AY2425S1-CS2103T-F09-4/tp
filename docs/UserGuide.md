## Beginner's Tutorial for Tuteez

If you're a new user, fret not! Simply follow this beginner-friendly tutorial that will walk you through your first
steps with the application, which will allow you to get comfortable with managing your student contacts effectively.

### Before You Begin
Make sure you have:
- Successfully installed Tuteez and launched the application (Refer to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section if you have not)

### Starting with a Clean Slate
Let us start by clearing the sample data that comes with the application. Type `clear` in the Command Box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

You should see a message indicating that all entries have been cleared, and the list of students should now be empty.

If everything went well, you'll be greeted by this view:
![clear_command](images/clear_command_tutorial.png)

### Adding Your First Student
Let's say you already have a student named John Doe, and you wish to add his details into Tuteez.

Let's try entering the following command: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/Jurong West`

This means that you've added a student named `John Doe`, with the phone number `98765432`, email `johnd@example.com`,
and address `Jurong West`.

If everything went well, you'll be greeted by this view:
![add_command](images/add_command_tutorial.png)

> :information_source: For more details on the `add` command, please refer to the [Add Command](#adding-a-student-add) section.

### Adding a Lesson to your Student's details
Now, you have finalized a lesson schedule with John Doe, and you wish to add it to his details.

Let's try entering the following command: `addlesson 1 l/Monday 0900-1100`

This means that you've added a lesson for `John Doe` on `Monday` from `9 am to 11 am`.

If everything went well, you'll be greeted by this view:
![addlesson_command](images/addlesson_command_tutorial.png)

### Editing Student Details
You've realized that you've made a mistake in John Doe's email address, and wish to edit it.

Let's try entering the following command: `edit 1 e/johndoe@gmail.com`

John's email address should now be updated to `johndoe@gmail.com` and the updated email address should be reflected in Tuteez.

If everything went well, you'll be greeted by this view:
![edit_command](images/edit_command_tutorial.png)

> :information_source: For more details on the `edit` command, please refer to the [Edit Command](#editing-a-student-edit) section.

### Deleting a Student
John Doe has decided to stop engaging your tuition services, and you wish to remove him from your list of students.

Let's try entering the following command: `delete John Doe`

John Doe should now be removed from your list of students.

If everything went well, you'll be greeted by this view:
![delete_command](images/delete_command_tutorial.png)

### Wrapping Up
Congratulations! üòÅ You've successfully completed the beginner's tutorial for Tuteez.
You're now ready to move on to more advanced features and commands that Tuteez has to offer.
Simply visit the [Features](#features) section to learn more about the various commands available to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Math` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Secondary`, `t/Math t/Science` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Things you should definitely know ü§î

### Constraints to add a lesson

Unfortunately, as of `V1.5` there are a few important constraints regarding lessons:  

  1. Lessons are not allowed to overflow into the next day
  1. Group tuition is currently not supported, so adding overlapping or clashing lessons is not available yet  

This means the following constraints apply:

  1. Lesson start time must be before end time (e.g. `1600-1500`)
  1. Lesson start and end time cannot be identical (e.g. `1300-1300`)
  1. The latest lesson start time is `2358`
  1. The latest lesson end time is `2359`, `0000` is treated as the start of a new day

Look forward to [future updates](#future-features) for group tuition support!!

### Current Limitations

As of `V1.5`, our app has a few limitations outlined below. Rest assured we, plan to resolve them in [future updates](#future-features)

1. Remarks and lessons can only be added one at a time
1. If you wish to edit a remark or lesson, first delete the incorrect one, then add the updated version.
1. After using the find command to locate student(s), running most other commands will reset the left panel to the default view, similar to calling `list`.
1. Tags that are too long are cut off on the left panel

### Saving the data

Tuteez data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Tuteez data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Tuteez will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause Tuteez to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Future Features

With the ever-changing responsibilities of tutors, Tuteez evolves right alongside you, adding new features to support your journey. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs in store for future updates!

1. Group Lessons: Tuteez will soon support overlapping lessons and student grouping for group tuition! And as always, it will alert you in advance if there are any scheduling conflicts. üòâ
1. Document Management: Upload and associate PDFs or other documents directly with specific students for easy access and organization.
1. Quick Messaging: Instantly open WhatsApp or Telegram chats with students directly from Tuteez with a single click, making it easy to reach out right away.
1. Data Export: Enable seamless exporting of student information and lesson data into files for easy sharing, backup, or analysis outside of Tuteez.
1. Of course, addressing all the limitations stated [above](#current-limitations)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Tuteez home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
